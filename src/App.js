			<p>
			UNSW Canberra Space is a group based at ADFA designing and satellites for research purposes. It has a mix of researchers and engineers to produce and operate the satellites.
			As a member of the electronics engineering team I developed hardware, firmware, software, performed manufacturing, testing, and process improvement.
			</p>

			<p>
			Working with hardware I manufactured and tested a number of flight boards following specialised handling and cleaning procedures to ensure high reliability and to avoid issues that arise from the vacuum of space. I also was training in bonding solar panels to PCBs and large components to mitigate vibration failures. I worked in a clean room environment to assist with assembly and testing.
			</p>

			<p>
			I participated in designing the next generation satellite system with a new mechanical layout and bus to improve capability and manufacturability from the current designs. I designed multiple boards for the next generation satellite. I also actively pursued and implemented new technologies to improve our capability and reliability.
			</p>

			<p>
			The satellites carry a secondary camera system which I developed the firmware for, including testing and documentation. I also developed firmware and scripts for hardware testing. Software to enable optical testing and calibration, and improvements to the ground station software system.
			</p>

			<p>
			I also worked on process improvements for the team. This included introducing source control procedures for the electronics projects using git, component inventory management, and exploring options to improve the manufacturing speed and capability.

			<p>
			Enabled by my partnerâ€™s move interstate for work, I established myself working on independent projects to meet gaps I observed in the market.
			</p>
			<p>
			The major project I worked on is a heat sensor based microwave to allow heating of food based on internal temperature rather than power and time.  I produced a prototype and presented on the software at Linux Conference Australia before concluding that, while technically sound, it was not commercially viable for me to pursue.  Other projects included developing a PIR movement sensor replacement that used thermal vision to avoid the movement requirement, an alarm system for travellers staying in hotel rooms, and a flexible LED sign to allow scrolling messages at football matches. All products developed to an initial prototype stage.
			</p>

			<p>
			This built my whole of system design experience, bringing together a product from concept to selecting each component of the system, building the environment, software and hardware. It has also been invaluable in building my business, marketing and financial skills.
