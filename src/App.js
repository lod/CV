			<p>
					I was a senior member of the VICSES, a volunteer emergency response service responsible for storm, flood, rescue and assisting other emergency agencies on the Bellarine peninsula.
			</p>
			<p>
			As Deputy Controller of Operations of the Bellarine unit I developed my leadership and management skills.  I managed a team of six volunteers with responsibility for ensuring our operational readiness through ongoing maintenance, scheduling and planning. Working with highly skilled members I enabled their work by liaising with external stakeholders, acquiring the equipment and coordinating significant work. As a member of the unit management team I also intervened on personnel issues, particularly those arising during operations.
			</p>
			<p>
			During significant localised storm events I performed the role of divisional commander setting the strategy for the response.
			This involved coordinating teams on the ground, managing logistics such as meals and transport, ensuring team member wellbeing including managing fatigue, triaging jobs, liaising with incident control staff, and managing CFA support. During these events I led over eighty responding personnel at the Bellarine unit.
