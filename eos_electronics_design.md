Thank you for the opportunity to apply for this position.

I am an experienced electronics design engineer and am very interested in working for EOS on your new defence projects.

I spent several years working for Northrop Grumman - M5 Network Security and enjoyed working in the defence industrial sector. I have a NV1 security clearance, currently inactive, from that time and look forward to a chance to rejoining the defence space.

I have worked in electronics design for many years and have developed multiple systems. Most recently I have have been working as a casual electronics engineer at UNSW Space, working on manufacturing and testing satellite circuitry. In that role I have also designed a board for the ground support system which integrated an ARM Linux computer with multiple Microchip Microsemi boards. In other roles I have built experience with Cypress PSOCs, AVRs, Texas Instruments MSPs, and NXP's LPCs.

Much of my career has been as a firmware developer. I have degrees in both engineering and software development. Typically working with no operating system or low level RTOS', I have developed using the aforementioned processors as well as the XILINX Microblaze cores. These designs include unit tests, system tests and release management.

In many roles over the course of my career I have demonstrated expertise in interpreting specifications, reviewing and preforming PCB layout, undertaking official Altium training, performing EMC testing and designing modifications, and conducted a TEMPEST evaluation.

Thank you again for considering my application, I am keen to further discuss my suitability for this role.


Sincerely,

David Tulloh
