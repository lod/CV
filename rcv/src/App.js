			<p>
			Enabled by my partnerâ€™s move interstate for work, I established myself working on independent projects to meet gaps I observed in the market.
			</p>
			<p>
			The major project I have worked on is a heat sensor based microwave (to allow heating of food based on internal temperature rather than power and time).  I produced a hardware prototype and presented on the software at Linux Conference Australia before concluding that, while technically sound, it was not commercially viable for me to pursue.  Other projects I have worked on include developing a PIR movement sensor replacement that used thermal vision to avoid the movement requirement, an alarm system for travellers staying in hotel rooms, and a flexible LED sign to allow scrolling messages at football matches. All products developed to an initial prototype stage.
			</p>

			<p>
			This experience has built my liaison skills working directly with suppliers and manufacturers both in Australia and overseas.  It has also been invaluable in building my business, marketing and financial skills.
