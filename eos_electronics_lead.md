Dear ...,

I am writing to apply for the Electronics Team Lead position at EOS Space Systems.

I bring a breadth of experience which makes me highly qualified for the many facets of this role.

My CV goes into further detail however I bring:...

**Leadership** I currently manage and lead a diverse team at FifthDomain.
**Electronics** As an electronics design engineer I have the qualifications and experience developing electronics hardware using Altium Designer.
**Software** As a software developer I have experience ranging from microcontroller firmware, small linux systems, and distributed cloud based programs.
**Documentation** In all of my roles I have produced and lead changes around the documentation of systems and processes.
**Solve problems** Complex problems are the reason that I do the work that I do, decades of experience collaborating with others to reshape complex problems into regular easily managed boxes.

Given the wide range of tasks covering management, maintenance and full stack development, I believe my breadth of experience makes me well suited to this role. I look forward to the opportunity to work with EOS to solve interesting problems.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this position further in person
