# Degree and experience

I graduated from the ANU with an honours degree in engineering, majoring in robotics and computer vision with significant study in electronics and communications. I also have a degree in IT with a major in software development.

In the subsequent fifteen years I have worked in electronics engineering and software development. I have a number of years experience in electronics design.


# Demonstrated ability to design and produce PCBs

As a design engineer I have professional experience across the entire production lifecycle of PCBs including leading work on concept creation, circuit design, layout, and manufacturing. I have participated in the design of core products as part of a multiengineer team, and designed test harnesses individually. Most recently ,working for myself, I designed three systems from concept through to prototype.


# Experience testing and debugging

One of my primary tasks in many of my jobs has been debugging. My primary role for the Australian Antarctic Division was debugging faults and performing running repairs. Working for Northrop Grumman I fulfilled the role of level three support, debugging faults that eluded the technicians.

I has also been extensively involved in multiple layers of testing, from board bringup testing, firmware testing and integration tests. Working for Signav I also worked on mass manufacture testing, designing test procedures for production runs of hundreds of thousands of units and managing the results.


# The ability to analyse circuit performance

Design review has always been part of my electronics work. At Signav I designed and automated a system to measure our RF performance in far more detail than was previously possible, leading to an increase of our weak signal performance by several dB. At M5 I reviewed and documented a number of elements of the system, leading to minor changes such as fixing I2C address conflicts, and major changes such as driving the standby power system through several evolutions.



# The ability to work autonomously

Throughout my career I have worked in an autonomous manner. An extreme example of that was through my work with the Australian Antarctic Division. Working on Davis station my supervisor was in Hobart with a four hour time difference. Given the extreme geographic isolation I worked almost entirely autonomously in line with previously agreed priorities to achieve the division’s goals.  


# The ability to provide supervision

As a senior member of the Bellarine SES unit I led teams helping the community in storm and rescue events. I also coordinated multiple teams in large events and as the Deputy Controller of Operations ensured the unit's readiness through maintenance, training and growing the unit's capability. I have also provided technical supervision on project based activities.


# Excellent written and verbal communication skills

I have actively worked to hone  my communication skills as a complement to my technical abilities.  While in the Bellarine I volunteered weekly with an IT class at the local highschool. This built my ability to interact with people from different backgrounds, breaking down and explaining technical concepts to students to slowly build their understanding.

Interacting with the students regularly over a two year period I also built a non-technical relationship assisting them with motivation, direction and mental health issues. I also undertook a mental health first aid course to assist understanding people who need help.


# Ability to implement UNSW safety policies

Working as an engineer several of my roles have involved safety regulations and procedures, including being part of the Airservices safety group and working within the stringent safety rules of Antarctica. 

As Deputy Controller of Operations of the Bellarine SES a significant part of my role was to be across all the operating procedures, ensuring that they were understood, communicated through training and followed to ensure the safety of each member.  Given the highly hazardous nature of the work, it was critical I could ensure compliance with safety procedures including encouraging ongoing improvements to risk management.
