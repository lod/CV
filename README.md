This is a basic react website which generates my curriculum vitae.

It is massively overdesigned for a single static web page, but writing code is great procrastination for writing a CV.

Designed to be viewed by a browser, mobile and printed output. A script is also provided to generate a distributable pdf with custom margins and footers.
