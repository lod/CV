Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the position of Software Engineer (Test) at Seeing Machines. As an experienced firmware engineer I am looking for interesting work in Canberra with good people. Friends I know working at Seeing Machines have spoken highly of the company, the work and the culture.

I have extensive experience as a software and hardware engineer. In particular working for product development at M5/Northrop Grumman and SigNav I performed testing operations through the entire stack. This included product certifications, automated and manual tests, board bringup and verification, designing manufacturing tests, automating existing processes, and troubleshooting production bugs. These tests have covered the full range of unit, integration, system and acceptance testing.

With a broad range of skills I feel I would be well positioned to manage the diverse range of tasks required.
