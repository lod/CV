Dear Hiring Manager,

Thank you for the opportunity to apply for the position of Software Engineer (Test) at Seeing Machines. As an experienced firmware engineer I am looking for interesting work in Canberra with good people. Friends who work at Seeing Machines have spoken highly of the company, the work and the culture.

I have extensive experience as a software and hardware engineer, this provides me with a broad range of skills and positions me well to manage the diverse range of tasks requested.  

In particular working for product development at M5/Northrop Grumman and SigNav I performed testing operations through the entire stack. This included product certifications, designing manufacturing tests, board bringup and verification, and automating existing processes. In different roles and wearing different hats I have covered the full range of unit, integration, system and acceptance testing; this has included hardware, software and the intersection of the two.

I have consistently shown an aptitude and joy for troubleshooting difficult to find bugs in development and production systems. This was a significant factor in my employment by the Australian Antarctic Division to maintain the scientific experiments on Davis station.

I hope for an opportunity to discuss my suitability for this position in person.

&nbsp; 


Sincerely,

David Tulloh
